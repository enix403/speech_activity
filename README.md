# Speech Activity Recognition using Convolutional BiLSTM

## Overview
This project implements a Speech Activity Recognition (SAR) model using a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) architecture. The model identifies speech and non-speech segments in audio recordings.

The implementation is based by the paper ["A Hybrid CNN-BiLSTM Voice Activity Detector"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03529) by Nicholas Wilkinson and Thomas Niesler (2021).

## Dataset
The project uses the [Speech Activity Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lazyrac00n/speech-activity-detection-datasets), which includes audio files and their corresponding annotations.
